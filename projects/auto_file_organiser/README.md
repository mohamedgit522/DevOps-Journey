# Auto File Organizer

I often found my Downloads and project folders filled with a mess of mixed file types - images, PDFs, random text files, and old zips all jumbled together.

Instead of manually cleaning them up each time, I decided to apply my Bash skills to solve this problem and automate the repetitive task.

This script organizes any folder into subfolders based on file type, making it clean and manageable in seconds.


## Features

- Organizes files based on their extension or detected MIME type  
- Creates destination folders automatically if they don't exist  
- Basic logging to track what was moved and where  
- Works on macOS (requires Bash 4+)  

## Quick Install

Clone the repo and make the script executable:

```
git clone https://github.com/mohamedgit522/auto_file_organiser.git
cd auto_file_organiser
chmod +x organise.sh

```
Then run the script like this:

`
/opt/homebrew/bin/bash organise.sh [folder_path]
`

Replace [folder_path] with the directory you want to organize. If you omit it, the script defaults to your Downloads folder.

## Usage

By default, the script organizes the Downloads folder, but you can pass any target folder as an argument.

## Requirements
- Bash 4 or higher (macOS ships with Bash 3 by default)

- `file` command (comes with most Unix systems)

On macOS, you can install a newer version of Bash using Homebrew:

`brew install bash`

## Logging

All activity is logged in a file named organise.log in the same folder as the script. This includes timestamps, file names, and destination folders.

## File Type Support

The script currently supports the following categories:

- **Images:** jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp, webp

- **Documents:** pdf, docx, txt, csv

- **Audio:** mp3

- **Video:** mp4

- **Archives:** zip

- **Others:** fallback for anything not matched

You can add more types by editing the `FILE_TYPES` and `MIME_TYPES` mappings in the script.

## Roadmap

- Add --dry-run option to preview actions before running

- Add CLI flags for more control (`--help`, `--dry-run`, etc.)

- Add support for running as a cron job (currently not implemented â€” I prefer running it manually for now to keep control)

- Package for easier installation and reuse

## Why I Built This

This project started as a real problem-solving exercise: a messy folder full of mixed files.
It became a way to:


- Automate a repetitive task I was doing manually.

- Practice Bash scripting and automation.

- Learn Git and share a practical DevOps-related project on GitHub.
